            <p>
              At Woundtech, I modernized the company's DevOps ecosystem by introducing trunk-based development, artifact promotion, and one-click deployments, cutting release times from 3 hours to under 10 minutes. I led major upgrades including Aurora PostgreSQL (v11 â†’ v16) and the HAPI FHIR platform, which eliminated billions of legacy objects and saved thousands in extended support costs. By driving cloud cost optimization, I reduced AWS spend from $42K to $12K per month. I also enhanced security and compliance with WAF, secrets rotation, and SecurityHub improvements, helping the organization advance towards HIPAA and HITRUST certifications.

              At KPMG, I designed and implemented enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines that improved code quality and security through SonarQube, Trivy, and automated testing frameworks. I built secure AWS-to-EKS integrations for secret management, automated infrastructure with Terraform Enterprise, and streamlined operations with Ansible and dynamic inventories. My work on serverless deployments, Kubernetes orchestration, and observability with Prometheus/Grafana significantly improved scalability, monitoring, and compliance for client environments.

              At Infosys, I led governance and security across 15+ AWS accounts, ensuring compliance and operational excellence. I drove cloud migration projects, built CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and CodePipeline, and automated infrastructure using Ansible and Python. I deployed and managed Kubernetes clusters, enabling secure, scalable workloads while implementing HA/DR strategies for critical systems. My focus on automation, monitoring, and security improved efficiency, reduced downtime, and accelerated delivery across client engagements.

            <p>
              At Ericsson, I built and optimized cloud environments on AWS, deploying EC2 instances, configuring CloudWatch monitoring, and managing Linux/Windows systems. I introduced Docker containerization for web applications, improving scalability and reliability. Using Python automation scripts, I streamlined data management, enabled secure file transfers via S3 and SMB protocols, and reduced manual overhead. This role laid the foundation for my expertise in cloud, automation, and DevOps practices.
